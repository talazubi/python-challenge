## Project Overview 
The following repository is a challenge displaying my Python coding abilities. I am tasked with two main challenges: PyBank and PyPoll, each of which mmic real world scenarios where programming can automate complex calculations. 
The challenge effectively showcases my abilties in foundational python concepts such as data reading and using CSV files, and different functions and outputs. 
# PyBank 
The following folder is a financial analysis that tracks a company's profits and losses over a period of time. Python allowed us to calculate the total months of this period, the net total of profits/losses, the average changes and the greatest increase and decrease of profits. 
# PyPoll 
The following folder is an election analysis, in which python successfully automated the vote counting process. The challenge required me to find the total number of voters, the percentage and total votes received by each candidate, and who the winner ultimately was.
